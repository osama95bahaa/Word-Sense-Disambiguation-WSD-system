# Word-Sense-Disambiguation-WSD-system
Natural Language Processing

The goal of this project is to disambiguate the word “hard” in a set of test sentences.

I tested 3 different test sentences with different meaning of the word "hard" and test the disambiguation.

To run the code, just install the senseval corpus and run the code.
